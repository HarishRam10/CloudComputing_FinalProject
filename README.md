#### About
Coronary Heart Disease is a cardiovascular disease caused by the buildup of plaque and fatty tissue in the coronary arteries. This leads to the arteries limiting the amount of blood that enters the heart which if untreated, can lead to a higher chance of a heart attack. 

In this project, we have gone over relevant information about Coronary Heart Disease, the data we used, the services we implemented in AWS, the logical architecture, the data flow, the result and a demonstration of the Amazon Web Services in action.
